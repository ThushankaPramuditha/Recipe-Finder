- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-specific styling
- **Component Library**: Shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible UI components

### Component Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between pages, components, and utilities
- **Reusable Components**: RecipeCard and LoadingSpinner for consistency
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces for recipe data structure

### Routing Strategy
- **React Router**: Implemented for SPA navigation
- **Route Structure**:
  - `/` - Home page with search functionality
  - `/recipe/:id` - Individual recipe details
  - `/favorites` - User's favorite recipes

## üöß Challenges Faced & Solutions

### API Limitations
- **Challenge**: TheMealDB API search limitations (exact matches for some endpoints)
- **Solution**: Implemented multiple search strategies and clear user feedback

### State Synchronization
- **Challenge**: Keeping favorites state synchronized across components
- **Solution**: Used localStorage with useEffect hooks for real-time updates

### Responsive Design
- **Challenge**: Ensuring consistent experience across all device sizes
- **Solution**: Implemented mobile-first design with Tailwind's responsive utilities
